User Story #10: I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the #tweet-quote a element. This a element should include the "twitter.com/intent/tweet" path in its href attribute to tweet the current quote.

User Story #11: The #quote-box wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.

You can build your project by using this CodePen template and clicking Save to create your own pen. If you prefer to use another environment, then put this <script> tag into the body of your index.html file: <script src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js"></script>

Once you're done, submit the URL to your working project with all its tests passing.

Note: Twitter does not allow links to be loaded in an iframe. Try using the target="_blank" or target="_top" attribute on the #tweet-quote element if your tweet won't load. target="_top" will replace the current tab so make sure your work is saved.
